## HEY there! 👋

I’m Pietro, a university student based in Italy.

I design and build whatever I can imagine.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is Python, C and a little of SQL. My favorite tools are Visual Studio Code, Replit and SQL Workbench.

Fun Facts:

    I have a girlfriend that is like a cat
    I love coffee
    Sword Art Online is my favorite anime
    My dream is to build a virtual world like Aincrad (SAO's world)
    Hobbies: anime, gym, building things
